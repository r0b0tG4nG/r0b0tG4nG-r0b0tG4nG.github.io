**> Who am i??**<br>

I'm Saeed Bala Ahmed, a great fan of _“Mr. Robot Series”_ where I got my nickname **r0b0tG4nG**. I am an offensive security engineer with over 4 years of experience with government and private cybersecurity contractors. I currently work at Tenikese Tech Solutions as a Penetration tester. I have a strong passion for penetration testing, bug hunting, CTF’s & other security-related topics. I spend most of my time pwning vulnerable systems on [EchoCTF.Red](https://echoctf.red/profile/5630024 "EchoCTF Profile"), [PwnTillDawn](https://online.pwntilldawn.com/Achievements/2101 "PwnTillDawn Profile"), [HackTheBox](https://app.hackthebox.com/profile/234268 "HackTheBox Profile") & [Proving Grounds](https://www.offensive-security.com/labs/ "Proving Grounds").<br> 


**> The Story begins**<br>
Well i am not a good story teller and i know there are thousands of *OSCP* stories out there but i will try my best to sum up everything. I've always spent my time on discord either hacking with friends or discussing hacking related topics. i love cybesecurity and I spend all my time on [EchoCTF.Red](https://echoctf.red/ "EchoCTF Profile"), [PwnTillDawn](https://online.pwntilldawn.com/ "PwnTillDawn Profile"), [HackTheBox](https://app.hackthebox.com/ "HackTheBox Profile").<br>

To be honest, i have spent quite a lot of time on these platforms. Dating back in 2019, judging from my performance on these platforms, most of my friends convienced me to take the `OSCP` exam but guess what i was too scared to take the stand i think it was the right decision. There is no need to rush in life. What's meant to happen will surely happen and one shouldn't rush into making some decisions.....<br>


**> Fast Forward OSCP Preparation**<br>
I was awarded a 90-day lab voucher by Black Cybersecurity Association on `July 5, 2021`, i redeemed the voucher on `10th of July 2021` then scheduled to start `PWK Labs` a week after which was on `18th of July 2021`. I had a whole lot of tension mounted on me because the hype around OSCP is so great that when i am going to rate i will say out of 10 people taking oscp, only 3 will pass on their first attempt. Two of my friends who wrote the `OSCP` exam before i even got this voucher failed.<br>

This alone was enough to scare me but what good will i derive from been scared? Three days to the `PWK` labs time, my mentor advised that the best way to build confidence and also to secure a passing mark is to work on my `buffer overflows` skill. `I am as bad as the word bad` in terms of exploiting buffer overflows. We started with some Linux `binaries` then moved to windows.<br>
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67085453/143930403-7c8eb46b-9fa5-4a9b-9af0-129ee73533d6.png)<br>

My mentor tasked me to follow the guidelines from <a href="https://tryhackme.com/room/bufferoverflowprep"> Buffer Overflow Prep Room</a> to solve `OVERFLOW1 `. I executed this task and i took me about 40mins to solve a `windows buffer overflows`. My confidence grew from `0.00%` to `2.00%` because i was able to face the fear for `windows buffer overflows exploitations`.<br>

*New challenge* from my mentor was to solve all the other `OVERFLOW` tasks without looking at any writeup. Guess what?? in about `3hrs` i solved all `9 OVERFLOW` tasks on  <a href="https://tryhackme.com/"> TryHackMe</a>. My confidence rose from `2.00%` to `20.00%`. On the same day, i was able to solve all <a href="https://tryhackme.com/">TryHackMe</a> rooms that had a windows buffer overflow vulnerability.<br>

My love for buffer overflows started on that day. I reached out to most of my friends on discord asking for links to any windows binary/software that is vulnerable to buffer overflow. I gathered about `15 windows Binaries/softwares` and with these binaries, i was able to reduce my `buffer overflow` solving time from `40 mins` to `15minutes`.<br>

`PWK Lab Access` started on `18th of July 2021`. On `day 1`, i jumped straight to hacking the lab machines and I was able to compromise `5 machines` without help. This streak continued for some time until i had `35 machines compromised without any help`. I knew there was trouble waiting for me ahead beacuse the road can't be this smooth. From time to time especialy at a stage where i had fully compromise 45+ machines in the labs, the situatsion changed. I got stuck on some crazy targets so, whenever i run out of options i would go knocking on the doors of my friends and the `OffSec` community. Some were helpful while majority gave answer `try harder`. Keep in mind that  the `try harder` replies  was meant to teache me to dig deeper and also step out oof the comfort zone. This attitude really helps alot since you will be forced to read more and also teach you to be independent.<br>

**> Asking help and reading hints**<br>
I have heard a lot of people saying asking for help and also reading hints is not helpful. I `strongly disagree` with that. `What happens when you are stuck for a really long time and all what you have tried doesn't work out even after taking breaks??`. I advice `go ask for help or read a hint`. When asking for help, do not try to get direct information on how to solve the challenge but rather find out if `what you are doing is right, what are you missing? are there any ways apart from your way?`. Keep one thing in mind. `Just don't focus on how to solve a machine but rather focus on learning what the target is teaching you`. Each target in the offsec labs has a something different to offer. <br>


`Pain`, `Sufferance`, `humble` and `gh0st`, these targets are popularly known as the `big 4` in the `offsec community`. i spent a great deal of time on trying to compromise these machines. They are harder than any other target in the `offsec labs` but you will learn alot from them once you decide to pawn these machines. In short, i completed all `75 PWK Lab Machines` in `72 days`. I learnt a whole lot from the labs especially `pivoting, privilege escalation` & `manual sqli`. The spnet the remaining `18days lab access` to help others in the community who were stuck on targets until the final day. <br>

**> Exam Preparation**<br>

On `October 10th, 2021` i booked an exam for `20th November, 2021 22:00 GMT`. Why a huge interval and wait time?? I still wasn't confident in myself even after compromising all `75 offsec labs` so i thought it will be wise to to spend the remaining time hacking on different platforms. I went back to [EchoCTF.Red](https://echoctf.red/ "EchoCTF") and [PwnTillDawn](https://online.pwntilldawn.com/ "PwnTillDawn"), spent some good amount of time there hacking any machine that i come across. I highly encourage the public to sign up on these platforms, there is a lot to learn from them. On `October 18th, 2021` i purchased a month subscription on [Proving Grounds Practice](https://www.offensive-security.com/labs/ "Proving Grounds").<br>

The Secret is, i used the [Proving Grounds](https://www.offensive-security.com/labs/ "Proving Grounds") machines to simulate a `test OSCP exam`. Luckily on my part, most of my friends were also preparing for their `OSCP` exams too. `Four friends` who happen to be my study mates took their exam before me. Unfortunately `3 failed the exams while only 1 passed`. I was scared because i am next in line wouldn't you be scared if it was you??. The question was will i `fail` or `pass` this exam? What my friends and i usually did was, we will select 5 machines from `PG Practice` and these machines were mostly `(2 20points, 2 25points & 1 10pointer)`, Hack these machines in 24hrs without help to simulate the `OSCP` exams, make a report after which we compare our reports. Why did we do this?<br>

> 1. To build up report writing skills.<br>
> 2. To learn each other’s methods of attacking targets.<br>
> 3. To learn how to work under pressure.<br>

Time flies like an arrow, lo and behold, my `PG practice` time expired on `November 18 2021` which means i am left with `48hrs` before my `OSCP` exam. I decided to revisit `buffer overflows` again just to be sure i wasn't leaving anything out. I downloaded more binaries from <a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/?platform=windows&type=remote&tag=31"> Exploit-DB</a> to test my `bof` exploitation skills. On `November 19th 2021` i spent all day working on `buffer overflows` i heard `buffer overflow` is a `25 pointer` machine in `OSCP` exam and i didn't want to miss that `25 points`.<br>

**> Exam D-Day: Dawn Of A New Era**<br>

`20th November, 2021` approached faster than i imagined, my exam starts at 22:00GMT. My day started great, I played games on my PlayStation 4 `God Of War 4` & `Ghost Of Tsushima` just to clear my mind. Well, something strange happened. On the day of exam, i wasn't scared anymore i was rather excited that i was about to write my `OSCP exam`. I said to myself `"boy, you have to get this in one shot. Give the exam your all so in the end you won’t have any regrets"`. At 11am, decided to spend some time watching movies and talking with special other till 4pm GMT. My internet at home is really bad so i decided to write the `OSCP` exam at work. Everything i needed for the exam was packed already in my bag including a different source of internet ( mobile router). I am all set to rock and roll, i left for work at `4:15pm GMT` with the `never say never attitude`. I usually have this attitude whenever there was a `CTF competition` which i looked forward to but on that day, i was in a whole different version of that `attitude`.<br>

The first thing i did at work was watch some `animes` on the work laptop from 4:40pm GMT to 8:30pm GMT. I did all i could to avoid touching my laptop because when i do touch my laptop, i will end up doing something else. At 9:00pm i turned on my laptop, double checked all the snapshot & backups of my VMware. I advise take snapshots and full clones of your `VmWare Machines`. I had `a full standalone clone`, `a full backup of the VMware machine on an external ssd and also another backup on another ssd`. I have read from many blogs that during the exam, alot of people's `VM's` crashed. For some, snapshots saved them while other had no option than to switch to their backup `VM's`. Attached is a image of my `VM snapshot manager`. <br>

Then i started watching privilege escalation videos, read more `OSCP` blogs online. Why did i read more blogs last minute? i wanted to learn from their mistakes. What they did wrong, what advice do they have? how did they mange the stress and pressure?? after a while i stopped reading. I replied my messages on whatsapp, some family & friends said a prayer, others said to me "r0b0t `Try harder`". I replied them with this sentence `i will do my best and if it's not enough i will go plus ultra`. i made up my mind that i will not have any regrets after this exam and i will do all i can & try all what i know. Next thing i did was to say a short prayer. `My Lord You Have brought me this far and  i know You did not bring me here to leave me hanging. I am because YOU are, all i need is the strength to handle this exam do not forsake me my Lord`. <br>

**> Exam Started**<br>

At `9:45pm GMT` i got an email from offsec to join the proctor. I logged in and did the necessary checks. Now i was ready for my exam. Exactly at `10:00pm GMT`, i got an email from offsec with my exam connection pack. So it all begins the moment we've all been waiting for.........:)<br>

`35 minutes` into my exam, i built a working `buffer overflow exploit` and was ready to claim my 25 points. One thing i did was: while i was working on `buffer overflows` i fired  `nmap` scans on the other targets. `1hr 45mins` into exam and i had `45 points` I completed the `20 pointer` machine in about `15-20mins` which increased my score to`45 points`. I spent close to an hour on the `10 points` machine but i finally popped a shell and rooted it. `Do not underestimate the 10points machine what you need is right infront of you but if you're not careful, you will miss it`. In a about `3hrs+ in OSCP exam` i had `55 points`. Now i was left with the last `25 point` & `20 point` machine.<br>

I decided to start with the `25 point` machine. After spending close to `4hrs+` on this machine i wasn't able to pop a shell. I decided to switch back to the `20 points` machine. After `2hrs+ of enumerating` i pop a shell on the `20 points` machine now i have a total of `65 points` (10 points from 20points machine). I spent 3hr+ on this box too and couldn't escalate privileges to root. In total I have spent close to `11hrs+` in the exam.<br>

I took a 15minutes break because it was `9:00am GMT`. I took some energy drinks `(lucozade)` as breakfast then jumped back to business. I spent more time on the `20 pointer box` but i still couldn't root it. To avoid stress, i jumped back to the `25 point` machine, started afresh from nmap scan and that was when i realized i was lost initially in a deep rabbit hole. I enumerated a specific service for some time trying different attacks on that service until i popped a shell. I finally had `75 points` i shouted `YEYYEEESSS!!!` i'm sure my proctor was laughing at me on the other end (OSCP pass score is 70points) and i was able to secure `75 points`. At that time, i was `18hrs+` into exams. As for the `25 pointer box` i couldn't find any privilege escalation vector on that because of .... sorry can’t talk about...<br>

I found a privilege escalation route on the `20 points` machine but i couldn't abuse it. Not sure if the issue was coming from how i exeuted my commands or the issue was from target machine i keep trying to root the `20 points` machine until the proctor closed my vpn access. I scored more than enough points to pass my `OSCP` exams but i still hate the fact that i couldn't root the `20 points` machine even after finding the privilege escation vector. I took a total of 4 breaks and drank about 3 bottles of `lucozade` energy drink. `Notes taking` is very important i madde sure to document evry step that worked and during the exam i created bacup copy of my notes to the `host` machine incase my `Kali VM` crashed i wont lose my data. <br> 

Whenever my head started to spin and i was about to give up, i watched 3 particular videos. This was the order i watched these videos. lol i watched them a billion times<br> 
> 1 Martin Luther King Speech <a href="https://youtu.be/MFOFs0iAwDg"> Watch Video </a><br>

> 2 Shakira - Try Everything ( Zootopia theme )
<a href="https://youtu.be/jpqV3dzYOgk"> Watch Video </a><br>

>3 Sami Yusuf - Make Me Strong
<a href="https://youtu.be/i3lqPUbYyTM"> Watch Video</a>

The Funny thing is that my laptop `froze completely 2x`🤣 yes you heard that right `2x`😁 during the exam. I am not talking about `VM freezing` i mean the whole `laptop` froze. Meanwhile i switched from a low end machine to <a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-laptops/alienware-m15-r4-gaming-laptop/spd/alienware-m15-r4-laptop/wnm15r420h">Alienware</a> so that i will have more resources alloated to the `VM` . I was lucky nothing crashed in the exam. Attached is an image of my `VM settins`<br>

**> Exam Ended & I Passed**<br>
The exam ended on `November 21, 2021` at `9:45pm GMT`. I made sure i had the neccesary screenshots for my report. I packed my stuffs, went home and i still couldn't close my eyes to sleep. The next day at `8am GMT` i started with report writting and at `7:30pm GMT`, i submited my report. The hardest part of the exam is waiting for the results. I checked my email a billion times. My exam results came in on `November 23, 2021` at `7am GMT` and i am proud to tell the world that I Saeed Bala is <a href="https://www.credly.com/badges/5e8534c3-e0fb-4bfe-9e39-d2f25a0fce50">OSCP Certified</a>.<br>

Last words, Never give up, believe in yourself and dare to chase the dream. Read Read read and ask questions regardless of how `stupid the question sounds`. It's okay to read writeups but just donnt get used to it. All that matters is make sure you learn something new but before reading a writeup make sure you have tried all possible options and none worked. keep pushing and you will reach greater heights. `If i can do it then you too can surely do it`. Keep this in mind `“Your strength doesn't come from winning. It comes from struggles and hardship. Everything that you go through prepares you for the next level.”` Keep pushing you can do it too my friend.  Thank you for reading and good luck in your exam. `You will ace it go for glory go for gold😇`
