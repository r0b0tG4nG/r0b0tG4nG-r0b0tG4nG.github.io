**> Who am i??**<br>

I'm Saeed Bala Ahmed, a great fan of _“Mr. Robot Series”_ where I got my nickname **r0b0tG4nG**. I am an offensive security engineer with over 4 years of experience with government and private cybersecurity contractors. I currently work at Tenikese Tech Solutions as a Penetration tester. I have a strong passion for penetration testing, bug hunting, CTF’s & other security-related topics. I spend most of my time pwning vulnerable systems on [EchoCTF.Red](https://echoctf.red/profile/5630024 "EchoCTF Profile"), [PwnTillDawn](https://online.pwntilldawn.com/Achievements/2101 "PwnTillDawn Profile"), [HackTheBox](https://app.hackthebox.com/profile/234268 "HackTheBox Profile") & [Proving Grounds](https://www.offensive-security.com/labs/ "Proving Grounds").<br> 


**> The Story begins**<br>
Well i am not a good story teller and i know there are thousands of *OSCP* stories out there but i will try my best to sum up everything. I've always joined my friends on discord almost all the time to hack. I spend all my time on [EchoCTF.Red](https://echoctf.red/ "EchoCTF Profile"), [PwnTillDawn](https://online.pwntilldawn.com/ "PwnTillDawn Profile"), [HackTheBox](https://app.hackthebox.com/ "HackTheBox Profile").<br>

To be honest on this, i have spent quite a lot of time on these platforms. Back in 2019 most of my friends believed i could pass the exam but guess what i was too scared to take the stand i think it was the right decision. There is no need to rush in life. What's meant to happen will surely happen and one shouldn't rush into making some decisions.....<br>


**> Fast Forward OSCP Preparation**<br>
I was awarded a 90-day lab voucher by Black Cybersecurity Association on *July 5, 2021*, i redeemed the voucher on `10th of July 2021` then scheduled to start `PWK Labs` a week after which was on `18th of July 2021`. I had a whole lot of tension mounted on me because the hype around OSCP is so great that when i am going to rate i will say out of 10 people taking oscp, only 3 will pass on their first attempt. Two of my friends who wrote the `OSCP` exam before me failed. <br>

This alone scared me but what good will i derive from been scared? Three days to the `PWK` labs time, my mentor advised that the best way to build confidence and also to secure a passing mark is to work on my `buffer overflow` skill. `I am as bad as the word bad` in terms of exploiting buffer overflows. We started with some Linux `binaries` then moved windows.<br>

My first task from my mentor was to solve `OVERFLOW1 ` one <a href="https://tryhackme.com/room/bufferoverflowprep"> Buffer Overflow Prep Room</a> following the guidelines. I did just that and the first time i solved `windows buffer overflows`, i used about 40mins even with the guidelines to follow. My confidence grew from `0.00` to `2.0` on windows buffer overflows exploitations.<br>

*New challenge* from my mentor was to solve all the other `OVERFLOW` tasks without looking at any writeup. Guess what?? in about `3hrs` i solved the other `9 OVERFLOW` task. Confidence grew from `2.0` to `20.0`. On the same day, i was able to solve all <a href="https://tryhackme.com/">TryHackMe</a> rooms that had a windows buffer overflow.<br>

My love for buffer overflows started on that day. I reached out to most of my friends on discord the next day asking for any windows binary/software that is vulnerable to buffer overflow. I gathered about `15 windows Binaries/softwares` and with these binaries, i reduced my `buffer overflow` solving time from `40 mins` to `15minutes`.<br>

`PWK Lab Access` started on `18th of July 2021` and on `day 1` i jumped straight to hacking the lab machines. I able to compromise `5 machines` without help. this  continued for some time until i had `35 machines without any help`. I knew there was trouble waiting for me ahead.  From time to time i got stuck and i went knocking on the doors of my friends and the `OffSec` community. Some gave the answer `try harder` while others were helpful but these answers never discouraged me.<br>

**> Asking help and reading hints**<br>
I have heard a lot of people saying asking for help and also reading hints is not helpful. I `strongly disagree` with that. `What happens when you are stuck for real and all that you have tried doesn't work out even after taking breaks?? Go ask for help` not on guided steps on how to solve the challenge but rather if what you are doing is right. Keep one thing in mind. `Just don't focus on how to solve a machine but rather focus on learning what the target is teaching you`. <br>


`Pain`, `Sufferance`, `humble` and `gh0st` these targets are popularly known as the `big 4` in the `offsec community`. i spent a great deal of time on these machines. In short, i completed the all `75 PWK Lab Machines` in `72 days`. I learnt a whole lot from the labs. The remaining `18days lab access` i used it to help the community until the final day. <br>

**> Exam Preparation**<br>

On `October 10th, 2021` i booked an exam for `22:00 GMT 20th September, 2021`. Why a huge interval and wait time?? I wasn't confident in myself so i thought of using the remaining time to hack on different platforms. I went back to [EchoCTF.Red](https://echoctf.red/ "EchoCTF Profile") and [PwnTillDawn](https://online.pwntilldawn.com/ "PwnTillDawn Profile") spent some good amount of time there. I highly encourage the public to sign up on these platforms there is a lot to learn. On `October 18th, 2021` i purchased a month subscription on [Proving Grounds](https://www.offensive-security.com/labs/ "Proving Grounds").<br>

The Secret is, i used [Proving Grounds](https://www.offensive-security.com/labs/ "Proving Grounds") as a `test exam` luckily for me almost all my friends were preparing for their exams. Two friends took their exam before me the `1 failed the exam while the other passed`. I was scared because i am next in line. What we did was we will select 5 machines `(2 20points, 2 25points & 1 10pointer)`, Hack these machines in 24hrs without help, make a report then compare or reports. Why did we do this?<br>

> 1 To build up report writing skills.<br>
> 2 To learn each other’s methods of exploiting services.

Time flies like an arrow, lo and behold, i was left with `48hrs` before my `OSCP` exam. I decided to revisit `buffer overflows` again just to be sure i wasn't leaving anything out. I downloaded more binaries from <a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/?platform=windows&type=remote&tag=31"> Exploit-DB</a> to test my `bof` exploitation skills.<br>

**> Exam Preparation**<br>

`20th September, 2021` approached faster than i imagined, my exam starts at 22:00GMT. My day started great,  started my day playing PlayStation 4 games `God Of War 4` & `Ghost Of Tsushima` just to clear my mind. Well, something strange happened, on the day of exam, i wasn't scared anymore i was excited that i will write my `OSCP` i said to myself. I am getting this in one shot give this my all so in the end i won’t have any regrets. At 11pm spent some time watching movies and talking with special other till 4pm GMT. My internet at home was really bad so i decided to take the exam at work. Everything i needed for the exam was in packed in my bag already including a different source of internet ( mobile router) Then i left for work.<br>

The next thing i did was watch `anime` from 4:40pm GMT to 8:30pm GMT. I did all i could to avoid touching my laptop because when i do, i will end up doing something else. At 9:00pm i turned on my laptop and double checked all my backups in VMware. Then i started watching privilege escalation videos on my laptop. I said a little prayer replied my friends messages everyone said to me r0b0t `Try harder` then i said to them `i will do my bestt and if it's not enough i will go plus ultra`. i made up my mind that i should not have any regrets after this exam i am doing all i can and trying all that i know<br>

**> Exam Started**<br>

At 9:45pm GMT i got an email from offsec to join the proctor. I logged in and did the necessary checks. Now i was ready for my exam. Exactly at 10:00pm GMT, i got an email from offsec with my connection pack. The magic begins.........:)<br>


`35 minutes` into my exam, i was done with my `buffer overflow scripts` and was ready to claim my 25 points. One thing i did was while i was working on `buffer overflows` i had already started `nmap` scans on the other machines  `1hr 45mins` into exam and i had `45 points` I completed the `20 pointer` machine in about `15-20mins` which increased my score to`45 points`. I spent close to an hour on the `10 points` machine but i finally popped a shell and rooted it. In a about `3hrs+ in OSCP exam` i had `55 points`. Now i was left with the last `25 point` & `20-point machine`.<br>
(image you can do it)<br>


I decided to start with the `25 point` machine. After spending close to `4hrs+` on this machine i wasn't still able to pop a shell. I decided to take go back to the `20 points` machine. After `2hrs+ of enumerating` i pop a shell on the `20 points` box now i have a total of `65 points` (10 points from 20points box). I spent 3hr+ on this box too and couldn't privsec to root. In total I have spent close to `11hrs+` in the exam.<br>

I took a 15minutes break since it was 9:00am GMT. I took some energy drinks to work. Drank a few of them then jumped back to business. I spent more time on the `20 pointer box` but i still couldn't root it. To avoid stress, i jumped back to the `25 pointer`. Started afresh from nmap scan and that was when i realized i was in a rabbit hole. I enumerated a specific port for some time trying different attacks on that service until i popped a shell. I finally had `75 points` by then i was `18hrs+` into exams. As for the `25 pointer box` i couldn't find any privilege escalation vector that because of .... can’t talk about...<br>

I found privsec  route on the 20 pointer but i couldn't abuse it. Not sure if the issue was coming from me or the target box but regardless i had enough points to pass my `OSCP` exams. I took a total of 4 breaks and drank about 3 bottles of lucozade energy drink.<br> 

Whenever my head started to spin and i was about to give up, i watched 3 particular videos. This was the order i watched these videos. lol i watched them a billion times<br> 
> 1 Martin Luther King Speech <a href="https://youtu.be/MFOFs0iAwDg"> Watch Video </a><br>

> 2 Shakira - Try Everything ( Zootopia theme )
<a href="https://youtu.be/jpqV3dzYOgk"> Watch Video </a><br>

>3 Sami Yusuf - Make Me Strong
<a href="https://youtu.be/i3lqPUbYyTM"> Watch Video</a>

The Funny thing is that my laptop `froze completely 2x` during the exam. Meanwhile i am using an <a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-laptops/alienware-m15-r4-gaming-laptop/spd/alienware-m15-r4-laptop/wnm15r420h">Alienware</a>. I was lucky nothing crashed in the exam.<br> 

**> Exam Ended & I Passed**<br>
The exam ended on `September 21, 2021` at `9:45pm GMT`. I made sure i had taken the neccesary screenshots for my report. I packed my stuffs and headed home. The next day at 8am GMT i started with report writting and at 6:30pm GMT, i submited my report. The hardest part of the exam is waiting for the results. I checked my email a billion times. My exam results came in on `September 23, 2021` and i am proud to tell the world that I Saeed Bala is <a href="https://www.credly.com/badges/5e8534c3-e0fb-4bfe-9e39-d2f25a0fce50">OSCP Certified</a>. Thank you for your time


Last words, Never give up, believe in yourself and dare to chase the dream. Read Read read and ask questions regardless of how `stupid the question sounds`. Its okay to read writeups but just donnt get used to it. All that matters is make sure you learn something new but before reading a writeup make sure you have tried all possible options and none worked. keep pushing and you will reach greater heights.
