**> Information Gathering**<br>

From nmap scan, we found a web app running on port `8081`. Navigating to port `8081` on the browser, we discovered  `Jfrog Artifactory` running on the target and we were redirected to a login page.<br>
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67085453/149589931-7a2fa7dd-e504-4aa0-b79d-58a74c7bcbf8.png)<br>

Reading <a href="https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF6X/Managing+Users">Jfrog Artifactory Docs</a> revealed the default admin username `access-admin` and one can change the admin password one is unable to obtain administrator access, one will need to recreate the default administrator user in order to be able to manage users of your system. This is done by using the following REST API call on the Access service, through Artifactory as its proxy.<br>

The issue at hand is we need to find the admin password before we will eb able to reset the administrators password. There is only one thing that comes in this situation which is `bruteforcing`. Why bruteforcing? remember we have a username `access-admin` already and we need to find his password to reset admin password.<br>

Bruteforcing the `access-admin` user account led to the discovery of his password `Password12`. What will you do in this situation?? try to login right? Well i did that and it failed because `access-admin` has `UI access disabled`.<br>

From the `Jfrog docs`, we found out that when we visit `/artifactory/api/access/api/v1/users` we will be able to retrieve all of the users in the system and their information. But to do  this, we must first submit credentials to the `HTTP form` found on the `/api` page. The credentials we found earlier on will work on this form. Username: `access-admin` & Password: `Password12`<br>

After logging in, and visiting the `/artifactory/api/access/api/v1/users` link, we were able to pull down a full list of users on the target. The two main users found on the target are `access-admin` & `admin`.<br>

Since we now know the `admin` username, we can recreate the default administrator account. How?? <a href="https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF6X/Managing+Users">Jfrog Official docs</a> says it all. To achieve this, we need the password for `access-admin` user which we have already. All requirements satisfied, i executed the command `curl -u access-admin:Password12 -X PATCH "http://10.13.38.19:8081/artifactory/api/access/api/v1/users/admin" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"password":"Rgang12345"}'`. With this command, i will be able to change the `admin` password.<br>

Password changed successfully all i need to do is login with the credentials Username: `admin` & Password: `Rgang12345`. With the admin user password changed, it is now possible to log into the UI with administrative privileges. <br>

It worked and we are able to login to the Jfrog UI as `admin` user with administrative privileges on the target. What's next? we have access what can we do? Well, this is the part the real challenge begins.<br>

**> Exploitation**<br>

Exploring the Jfrog application, Clicking on the `Admin Section` and selecting `System Logs` section, we found various logs, through these logs, we gained information about the application server as well as the internal network. The `access.log` and `request.log` file both indicated an internal IP address block of `192.168.125.x.`<br>
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67085453/149590149-219370aa-c070-4c24-b07c-ad9fc986148f.png)<br>

`Target internal IP structure leaked` what can we do with this information? we will look at that later. The next thing i did was to create a `repository`. To do this `Click Admin => local repositories => Generic => Save` name your repository then save.<br>
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67085453/149590169-24a7a498-7287-4d48-a001-a0e0533e63b3.png)<br>
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67085453/149590182-9160593d-4d68-4daf-a2dc-8fa8861600c0.png)<br>

The Jfrog application contains functionality to import local repositories. Digging deep into this functionality revealed that it is prone to a `server-side request forgery vulnerability` <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-19937">CVE-2019-19937</a> with this information, i fired up burpsuite and tried to import the `robot repository` i created. `Click Admin => Import & Export => Repositories => Import Repository from Path => Select Repository => C:\artifactory-oss-6.13.1\logs`.<br>
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67085453/149590199-7d723007-7936-4432-8acc-1f7c3bcb4b88.png)<br>

By modifying the `"path`" value to use a `UNC path`, it is possible to scan the internal network using prior information about the network scheme. This can be used to determine `live hosts`, and also to determine if there are any `shares` that are accessible by the user is whose context `Jfrog is running` in. The image is an example of the original request to import the `C:\artifactory-oss-6.13.1\logs` folder into a `robot repository`:<br>
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67085453/149590216-9299c594-628f-4a59-b68e-98a63029988c.png)<br>

Sending this captured request to `Burp Intruder`, the `"path"` is modified to contain `UNC paths` of `internal IP addresses` we found. The last octet will be used as a fuzzing point, allowing us to scan the internal network. The response times can be monitored to determine which hosts are alive.<br>
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67085453/149590240-4ff7d67a-cde8-40b5-9cca-ded68734bfe0.png)<br>

In burpsuite, we set the payload type to `numbers` with the range of `2-255`. From the burpsuite fuzzing response, we noticed that `a longer response` time from the target in the fuzzer indicates that the `host is not alive (or not accessible)`, while a `short response time` indicates an `accessible host`. From this, we discovered `3 alive hosts` which are `192.168.125.88`, `192.168.125.128` & `192.168.125.129`<br>
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67085453/149590272-6198637a-5036-4931-b007-fdbed96afdd3.png)<br>

Weaponizing ourselves with the discovered hosts, we will setup another burpsuite `Intruder payload` to discover `shares` on the target. We imported the following wordlist `/usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt` into burpsuite. A `200 response code` indicates that a share exists on the target.<br>
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67085453/149590280-559baabc-fcaf-4f2b-928f-0d0684c13915.png)<br>

We found nothing on IP addresses `192.168.125.88` & `192.168.125.128` but on `192.168.125.129`, we found some interesting shares `forums_old`, `Projects` & `development` that are accessible. <br>
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67085453/149590553-83e8b4b1-c2df-4c31-9798-14c1f625ae82.png)<br>

The `development` share looks interesting so we will try to import this repository. to achieve this, we have to follow this chain `Click Admin => Import & Export => Repositories => Import Repository from Path => Select Repository => \\\\192.168.125.129\\development`<br>
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67085453/149590584-b4c1690d-57ee-4b1b-9dd7-d250263720fc.png)<br>

This successfully imports the contents of the `development` share into the `robot repository`.<br>
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67085453/149590592-3ef5a655-484b-4db7-ae11-18ecf7c9f9dc.png)<br>

To examine the imported share in the `robot repository` we have to access `/artifactory/robot/` and this displays the files from the `development` share.<br>

In the `/artifactory/robot/feedback/` directory, we found `feedback.exe` and a `key.txt` file. In the next blog that will be published, we will dig deep into the `feedback.exe` and also discuss how it will lead to the exploitation of an application.<br>
