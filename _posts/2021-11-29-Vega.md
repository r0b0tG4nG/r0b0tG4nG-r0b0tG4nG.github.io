**> Information Gathering**<br>

In every engagement, one has to start with the usual information gathering. informationg gathering on nettwork devices will definetly include port scanning. Nmap is my favorite port scanning tool in every engagement. From nmap scan, we have the usual port 80 (http), 22 (ssh), the unusual 8089 (splunk) & 10000 (MiniServ Http).<br>

On port 80, we found a `Magento` shopping webapp. I admit i was lost on this target for serveral days becuase i was lost in a `rabbit hole`. `Rabbit holes` refers to a situation where a person is stuck on exploiting a wrong service thinking it will lead him/her somewhere.<br>

I used gobuster & wfuzz with uncountable number of wordlists hoping to find juicy directory on the webapp that wwill lead me somewhere. I tried all `SQL Injections` techniques on the web app but made no progress. Back to directory bruteforcing, i almost gave up on this box then i thought of why not try `dirb` without supplying any wordlist. so i ran `dirb http://10.150.150.222` and waited patiently. After a few seconds, `dirb` found a file which didnt make any sense to me.<br>

`Dirb` found the `.bash_history` file. This file keeps the history of bash commands and under normal circumstance, should be in a users home directory not unless this file belongs to the `www-data` user who's home directory is the default `/var/www/html`. The best thing  to do is to access this file in browser. I got mad when i finally made progress after days of trying.<br>

In this file, i found a command which contains a passowrd `mysqldump -u vega --password=puplfiction1994 magento2 > dumpmagento.sql`. Normally `mysqldump` command wont be logged int history file unless there is an typo in tthe command. for now we have something to play with. To verify this, i tried to access the `dumpmagento.sql` from the browser to see if it exists. Guess what, the file was found.<br>

My only assumption is that the password `--password=puplfiction1994` was wrongly typed. To confirm this, i generated a wordlist with possible mutation of the word `puplfiction1994` and run that against ssh using hydra. <br>

Hydra found the password `pulpfiction1994`. We know the username is `vega` so whats next? ssh into the target with the password `pulpfiction1994`. `ssh vega@10.150.150.222`<br>

Similar to <a href="https://r0b0tg4ng.github.io/posts/Stuntman-Mike/">Stuntman Mike</a> machine, the vega user has  `(ALL : ALL) ALL` permissions / rights assigned to him.<br>

We simply type `sudo su root` on the target. We have root level access on the target now. This was a simple but crazy box since it took me a while to find the `.bash_history` file.<br>
