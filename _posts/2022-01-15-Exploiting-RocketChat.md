**> Information Gathering**<br>

During our previous engagement on <a href="https://r0b0tg4ng.github.io/posts/Exploiting-Jfrog-Artifactory/">Exploiting Jfrog Artifactory</a> webapp, we leaked some files from the `development` share. Today's engagement, we will look at how to dump messages from the `Exploiting RocketChat` webapp. But before we jump into this, we will have to reverse a `windows binary`. Not to waste time here, letâ€™s get started....<br>

In the previous <a href="https://r0b0tg4ng.github.io/posts/Exploiting-Jfrog-Artifactory/">blog</a>, where we successfully leaked critical files from internal share to our repository `/artifactory/robot/feedback/` directory. We found a `windows executable` called `Feedbacks.exe`, let's grab the binary from the target.<br>

Executing the `file` command on the `Feedbacks.exe binary` reveals that we are dealing with a `.NET` binary. We will analyze this binary using a tool called
`dnSpy`.<br>

`dnSpy` is a `debugger` and `.NET assembly editor`. We can use it to edit and debug assemblies even if you don't have any source code available. We can grab this `dnSpy` tool from <a href="https://github.com/dnSpy/dnSpy"> dnSpy GitHub page</a>. Loading the `Feedbacks.exe` binary into `dnspy` shows that there is a  `namespace` called `RocketChatLogger` and a `function` called `GetFeedback` that is executing a web request.<br>

Investigating the `GetFeedback` function reveals that an `API call` is being made to a `RocketChat server`, which extracts messages from a `channel ID` and saves them locally to a text file called `Feedback.txt`. We also spotted that there is a `user ID` assigned to `X-User-Id` and a `key` assigned to `X-Auth-Token` all within the `X-Auth-Id header`<br>

Judging from how the binary was written, the actual API key can be leaked through active debugging of the program in dnSpy. All we need is to set a  `breakpoint` on the `GetFeedback` function, run the `debugger` then submit the contents of `key.txt` as an argument. The contents of key.txt was `111091166030218062251222010115128136114113076235134212137064020174229081049098149097150097197008100104224193046241175229075026048009246089192212`<br>

After submitting the contents of `key.txt` as an argument, the debugger will continue running the application until it hit the `breakpoint` we set earlier.  Once that is completed, the `decrypted API key` can be found in the `local variables` section. Our decrypted key is `"_bXOx5rjOpTOE3hEfJNTzjAdTWEFas2um7xNH13ylZL"`<br>

**> Exploitation Phase**<br>

Navigating to port `3000` which we found earlier from our nmap scan revealed that `Rocket.Chat` webapp is hosted on that port. Login form requires a `user email` & `password` but in this case we have none moreover `New user registration is disabled `<br>

Reading through the i realized one can grab all user list on the target by visiting `/api/v1/users.list` page. When we did, we got an error message which states that we must be logged in to display such content. How do we log in??<br> 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67085453/149619008-39237108-b359-4787-ac61-c84c8a1d4514.png)<br>

After digging for a while i realized that with a valid `user ID and API key`, it's possible to `construct API calls` to `extract information` from the `RocketChat server`. We will use burpsuite to capture the request and modify the `Headers` to include both `X-User-Id` & `X-Auth-Token`. The API endpoints that we will be targeting is well documented and can be found at <a href="https://developer.rocket.chat/reference/api/rest-api/endpoints/team-collaboration-endpoints/">developer.rocket.chat website</a> The first endpoint we will target is the `/api/v1/users.list`. More info can be found <a href="https://developer.rocket.chat/reference/api/rest-api/endpoints/team-collaboration-endpoints/users-endpoints/get-users-list">here</a><br>

We found some usernames but that didn't bear any fruit for us. Digging deeper, i tried to grab all `channels names` from the chat server, their respective IDs in order to retrieve the messages found on each channel. We Found 4 channels on the chat server. From the docs, channels list are found at `/api/v1/users.list` after visiting that link we found 4 channels: `hr_announcements`, `development_requests`, `gaming` & `infra` <br>
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67085453/149619018-377e4770-57f4-4d88-9147-099f1540719c.png)<br>
```shell
{"_id":"sPPBSQskQ4afSmMeJ", "name":"hr_announcements"},
{"_id":"eoxPkMvnBNCB8q9n8", "name":"development_requests"},
{"_id":"RDZXJPcnu76Tk4EHE", "name":"gaming"},
{"_id":"fBMPnhN5wWv96tNBp", "name":"infra"}
```

The `hr_announcements channel` is a place to look at as many `HR announcements` contain `key information` about the organization. Information such as on-boarding information and other details that can be used in subsequent attacks. To access the `hr_announcements channel` messages, we sent a `GET` request to `/api/v1/channels.messages?roomId=sPPBSQskQ4afSmMeJ`<br>
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67085453/149619021-12380853-6c4d-4ad9-8c89-578843871485.png)<br>

The `hr_announcements channel` messages contained a juicy information. The information stated that: `"msg":"Attention new employees: Please be sure to check the #onboarding_information channel.","ts":"2019-11-17T06:32:40.825Z",`. So it looks like there is a group called `#onboarding_information`, to find groups on the chat server, we will send a request to `/api/v1/groups.list`<br>
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67085453/149619024-695897a2-eefa-40d1-8456-d1756ca20427.png)<br>

Hehehe we found the group `#onboarding_information` exists and we found the `group ID` too `"_id":"2iHYAhwtJjbyj4a6N","name":"onboarding_information","fname":"onboarding_information"`. The next step is to read messages from this group chat. How do we do that? we need to send a request to the group `ID` so the url will be `/api/v1/groups.messages?roomId=2iHYAhwtJjbyj4a6N` and from that we will be able to retrieve all messages sent to that group. Other groups that were found include: `developers_chat`, `development_projects`, `known_issues` & `timeline_updates`

A workstation credentials can be discovered from one of the messages. However, the password `Welcome_roundsoft123` does not work for any of the users listed in RocketChat. Let's dig deeper into the data to see if there is any more information that is of use. To achieve this, we grabbed the `message ID` and made a request to `/api/v1/chat.getMessage?msgId=3mbfjW4TXPs4BQQvs` and we can spot the mentioning of a credentials issue. This discussion can be enumerated to reveals more information by making a request to the `Drid ID`.<br>

Sending a `GET` request to the `Drid ID` of the previous message, we are able to pull out all messages from that discussion. Voila we found another password  from the discussion `Welcome_roundsoft2019!` but the password does not work against any of the systems we have found. We can set this aside as well for potential use later.<br>

Nothing interesting found so far from the messages, so went back to the docs and from the docs, i realized we can query for `instant messages`. To do this we need to send a request to `/api/v1/im.list`. This revealed a new `instant message ID`.<b>
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67085453/149619114-cf3d4487-bdd1-4040-8133-39be9c97e89e.png)<br> 

Drilling into this new `Instant Message ID`, we can reveal the content of the conversation. We made another request to the `Instant Message ID` which is `/api/v1/im.messages?roomId=HTpmn63zyESXXsGZackBN4uDvbKecTqoBS`. This led to the discovery of a `Unix machine` username `beta_user` from the conversation.<br>
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67085453/149619118-d4917857-ae6f-4275-be98-06c1a06ccf2e.png)<br>

From the start, we discovered a group name `developers_chat` and looking at the new `Unix` user we just found `beta_user` which was mentioned by the user `dev-admin` user, We enumerated the `developers_chat` group. We know the group name already to make our work simple, we sent a request to `/api/v1/groups.messages?roomName=developers_chat`. Going through the messages, we discovered the presence of an `uploaded text file` which contains a `key` and requires an `appropriate username` before one can gain access to the `development network`<br>

Knowing the path and the name of this interesting attachment, we can grab the contents of this file by sending a request to `/file-upload/crBDvzQkhN77KLrxz/key.txt`. This `interesting key.txt attachment` turns out to be an `id_rsa` key for a user.<br>
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67085453/149619128-835a1887-7be0-4476-84df-1400b01b8e9a.png)<br>

`Id_rsa keys` belong to ssh services. We found a `Unix` user already `beta_user` from the `developers_chat`. Whatâ€™s next? The good old changing of permissions and logging into the target using the `id_rsa key`. We gained access to the target finally. Hehehe we all know the wide smiles we have on our faces after getting foothold on a target.<br>

I almost gave up on this webapp because it was too complicated. It pays to have a good number of friends around you who believe in you, encourage you and always fuel your can-do spirit. A big shoutout to `W0tW0tðŸ¤©`, `Th3D00msl4y3rðŸ™Œ` & the geeky fella `TheCyberGeekðŸ˜Ž` these guys kept me on my toes and made sure i never gave up until this webapp was exploited.<br>

I hope you enjoyed the ride and also discovered something new. Kindly subscribe to my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSY-pfwuYspZFlRsO7vBfIQ"> YouTube channel</a> for more contents<br>
