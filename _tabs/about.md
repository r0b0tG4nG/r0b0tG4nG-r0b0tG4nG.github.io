**> WORK EXPERIENCE**

> Penetration Tester at Data Systems LTD<br>
 At Data Systems LTD, my responsibilities extended beyond conducting penetration tests on computer systems, networks, and applications. I also innovated new testing methodologies to uncover vulnerabilities, performed security audits, and executed legal cyberattack simulations. This involved the development and utilization of specialized hacking tools to access specific data within predetermined timeframes. <br>

> CTF Team Lead / Offensive Trainer at Inveteck Global<br>
 At Inveteck Global, my role involves active participation in various Capture The Flag (CTF) events and hacking competitions, alongside training students. As a CTF Team Lead, I've had the privilege of competing and achieving victory in six international hacking competitions, as well as securing victories in several local competitions. <br>

> Content Developer at Servmor Security<br>
 At Servmor Security, my responsibility involved the development of training labs similar to those found on platforms like Hack The Box. These labs were designed to provide cyber security researchers with a practical environment to enhance their hacking skills. The labs encompassed a range of vulnerabilities, including the OWASP Top 10, and incorporated custom-designed vulnerabilities to replicate real-world scenarios. <br>

> Security Researcher / Bug Hunter<br>
 I specialize in researching vulnerabilities associated with web applications. My work involves uncovering T1-T4 bugs within a variety of web applications, spanning both private sector and government domains. Some of my research findings have been publicly documented on exploit-db.
